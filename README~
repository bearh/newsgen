About
-----
* RSS/Atom reader/feed thing.
* Written in Ruby.
* Produces pages based on what is in ./page_layout.rb
* This is not meant to be a overly complex thing.
* Can block keywords from article titles!
* Updated version of this mess: https://gist.github.com/bearh/5659921


Structure 
---------
Right now(prone to change):

scheduler.rb :: Gather feeds, builds sqlite db.
setup.rb :: sets up everything. I.e create db for everything else to use.
cache/ :: where pages get stored.
config.rb :: Configure stuff here.
page_layout.rb :: how your pages are layed out. Read file to understand how.
page_build.rb :: Builds the pages acording to your settings.


Setup
-----
* Add the scheduler to your users crontab. make it run every 10-15 mins, more if you have feeds that don't update very often.
* Chmod +x the code. chmod +x ./*.rb
* Enjoy your feeds.
